            <h4>Course description</h4>
            <p>

                In this course, we will study contemporary machine learning methods for understanding and generation of human language.  If you have taken
                machine learning and know how to implement, train, and deploy a classifier -- and now you want to understand how to bridge the gap between
                that and contemporary language models that can answer questions and hold a conversation, this course is for you.  Through a series of
                coding assignments, you will learn how to implement and train neural models to process language, from word-level embeddings to Transformer
                language models, including implementation, pre-training, fine-tuning and other modes of deployment of such models for handling different
                aspects of processing human language.
            </p>

                <b>Pre-requisite</b>: COMP 5420 / COMP 4420 Machine Learning or equivalent (with permission of instructor).
            </p>


            <h4>Class format</h4>

            <p>
                This course uses a “prepare-then-quiz” structure rather than traditional graded homework submissions.
                Most weeks, we will assign a homework assignment following the lecture, which will be described at 
                the end of class. You are explicitly permitted to use AI tools when completing these assignments, 
                with the expectation that the homework is used for practice, exploration, and understanding rather than 
                for submission. The homework itself will not be collected. Instead, each week at the beginning of 
                the next class, there will be an in-class quiz covering both the conceptual material from the 
                previous lecture and the practical coding components introduced in the homework. We will go over 
                the quiz answers immediately after the quiz, before the lecture.

                Please bring your laptop to class in order to follow the homework discussion and participate 
                in occasional brief tutorials when assignments are introduced.
            </p>
